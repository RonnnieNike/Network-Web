        <br>The Internet has evolved more or less like a castle, starting from a minimal core and gradually added new features. The evolution of the internet is based on the fundamental concept of abstraction, which represents the surface of a more complex realization; an abstraction always provides an interface so that you can take advantage of the functions it offers.
        When talking about a network it is normal to refer to a certain level of abstractions; the object of abstraction is communication and abstraction often consists of a communication protocol.
        In this case a communication protocol called ASDL is used.
        The global network:
        The network is divided between center and periphery, the periphery is occupied by users' devices and is characterized by a relatively moderate traffic since these have only one connection to the network (network interface); the center instead is reserved for devices controlled by companies, called suppliers or providers because they give services to users, and normally have more connections with the network.
        The global network is therefore divided into many local networks interconnected by devices called routers.
        Peripheral devices are attached to peripheral networks characterized by a point-to-point connection.
        The connection that reaches the houses is normally a point-to-point connection, while the one that reaches the workstations of the companies is a network.
        The devices connected to the network are called nodes.
        When we connect to the Internet via cable our computer becomes part of an ethernet-type network through a point-to-point connection. The communication between computer and manager is managed via modem.
        When instead you have a Wi-Fi network, a more typical situation in our homes, you get more than one internet connection:
        1. the modem is associated with a router that acts as a gateway to the peripheral computer,
        2. The computer is connected to a local network managed by our router
        3. the router is connected to the modem and through the telephone network and a switch
        4. the modem is connected to the provider with a point-to-point connection.
        5. The switch is connected to a subnet that connects various switches.
        6. Each sub-network has territorial coverage. Most of the peripheral traffic is concentrated here.
